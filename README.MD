DJ Gopher
----------
##Overview
The GO language is a language created by google in order to fullfill scalability, space, and run time needs.

DJ Gopher is a discord bot written in GO that has a couple of different functions which include:

Games/
    Hangman (1+ players)
    Connect Four (2 players)
    Trivia (2-6 players)
Music
    Pop
    Punk
    Rock 
    Sound Effects

The bot is only interactable in Discord, a chat client, and must be running on a server or computer in order to connect to Discord and function properly. 

Once the program is running, no further input besides that in Discord chatbox is needed. 


##Installing Environment:

To get started with GO, head over to the official downloads page and click on the OS being used. https://golang.org/doc/install

In order to write in GO, a text editor is needed. Visual Studio Code is popular editor with plugin support for GO. Although most editors will suffice.
